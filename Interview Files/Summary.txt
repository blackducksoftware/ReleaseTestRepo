Counting lines of code in Java source is not quite as simple as it seems.
 
Please write a utility that counts the number of lines of actual code in a Java
source file. For the purpose of this exercise, a line is counted if it contains
something other than whitespace or text in a comment.
 
Remember that Java comments are either // to the end of line, or /* to the next
*/. The block comments do not nest. There may be multiple /* â€¦ */ comments on a
line. Whitespace includes tabs, spaces, carriage returns, and vertical tabs.
 
This problem can take well over an hour to fully complete. If you do not think
there will be sufficient time to handle all cases, please consider starting with
smaller tasks that can show some progress.
 
Such as:
 
- Count all the lines in a file.
 
- Omit lines that are just whitespace or single line comments.
 
- Omit lines that are part of multiple line comments.
 
- Handle edge cases (comments can start at the end of lines, nested comments)
 
Please keep in mind - being able to demo executing code and discuss your work is
vastly more important than completing the utility.
